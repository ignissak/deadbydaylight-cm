# DeadByDaylight

DeadByDaylight is a Minecraft minigame heavily inspired by the game Dead by Daylight (made by Behaviour Interactive) and The Hive's Halloween Minigame.

## Point of the minigame

4 survivors must survive and escape the arena. They are hunted by 1 killer. Survivors have to find fuel and activate generators that will power up opening mechanism of the gates.

### Survivor mechanics

Survivors have limited vision and heavily rely on using flint and steel to see around them. They have limited health that can be regenerated by using bandages. All items can be found in chests around the map and randomly on the ground. Survivors can revive downed survivors to keep them alive. If a certain survivor is downed too many times, they will be permanently dead.

### Killer mechanics

Killer has an axe and fishing rod. Axe is the ultimate weapon that can kill survivors but has large cooldown. Fishing rood can be used to hook survivors closer to the killer. If the killer hits survivor with less/equal to 2HP, they will be downed. 

## Development background

Minigame is coded in Kotlin and originally for version 1.16.3. It can no longer be compiled because of the use of proprietary libraries that are no longer available to the public.
